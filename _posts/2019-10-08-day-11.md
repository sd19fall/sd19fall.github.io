## Today

* More classes
* MP3 consulting time

## For Next time
* Today's class marks the midpoint of MP3. 
Take a look at the [suggested milestones](/assignments/mini-project-3-text-mining.html#suggested-milestones) to make sure you're on track.
While there's not an official midpoint submission due beyond the check-in survey from last time, we strongly recommend discussing with course staff about your ideas, plans, and questions.


## Reading Journal Debrief

The Reading Journal included this list of terms and concepts:

 - class
 - object
 - instance
 - attribute
 - method
 - shallow vs deep copying
 - pure functions vs modifiers
 - initializing object instances

Which of these should we discuss more?
Think back to your work on the last two Reading Journals and `geometry.py`.
What Class concepts are still confusing?

### Bad Kangaroos

In this Reading Journal we looked at a very common error that can be very frustrating to debug:

```python
class Kangaroo:
    def __init__(self, name, contents=[]):	# Warning: mutable default argument bug!
        self.pouch_contents = contents
```

The core "[gotcha](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/gotchas/#mutable-default-arguments)" here is that default argument values are evaluated *once* when the function is defined, not every time it is called.

In this case, it means that the new list is created one time, and each new `Kangaroo` instance (that did not provide contents to override the default) has a reference to the same list.

This would be true of any mutable object as a default argument, not just `list` (e.g. `dict`, or your custom classes). Here is another implementation, showing a Python idiom commonly used to avoid this bug:

```python
class Kangaroo:
    def __init__(self, name, contents=None):
        if contents == None:
            contents = []
        self.pouch_contents = contents
```

Here we've used `None` (immutable) as a stand-in for the case when no contents have been passed and we should create an empty list. The new list is created inside the body of the `__init__` method when it is called, so each `Kangaroo` instance gets its own empty list vs a shared reference.

> **General advice**: avoid using mutable objects as default values of function arguments.

### Agenda: sorting objects

For this Reading Journal, you had to implement a `print_agenda` method that displays `Event` objects in chronological order.
The key challenge here was sorting the `Event`s: Python provides many
[techniques for sorting](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html),
but they don't know how to sensibly sort your custom objects without some help from you.

Let's imagine that you have a list of `Event`s.
The first design choice to make is whether you should maintain the list in sorted order at all times, or sort it only when required (e.g. whenever `print_agenda` is called). There are pros and cons to each style, depending on application:

#### Always sorted

In this case the burden falls on your `add_event` method to ensure that you insert new `Event`s in chronological order (perhaps using your `is_after` method). It takes a little more time to add an `Event`, but you afterwards you can rely on the list being sorted at no extra cost.

#### Sort on demand

With this approach you have a simpler insertion process, but you must sort the list every time you need it to be in order. This may be more expensive depending on whether adding new `Event`s or printing the `Agenda` is more common.


Python knows how to sort built-in types (e.g. integers), but not your custom classes. Let's say you have a `Time` class:

```python
class Time:
    def __init__(self, hour=0, minute=0, second=0):
        self.hour = hour
        self.minute = minute
        self.second = second

    def to_int(self):
        return 60*(60*self.hour + self.minute) + self.second
```

#### Sorting key function
Python's `list.sort` method and `sorted` function both take an optional `key` parameter, which expects a function that takes the object to be sorted and returns a key used to sort it. We could write such a function for `Event`s:

```python
def event_start(event):
    """Given Event object containing a start Time, return time as sortable key"""
    return event.start.to_int()
```

and then use it to sort a list of Events:

```python
for event in sorted(some_events, key=event_start):
    ... do something
```

#### Anonymous lambda functions

If you just want to sort `Event`s, it can be a bit clunky to write the `event_start` function solely to pass as a `key` parameter.
You'll often see people use an anonymous `lambda` function (a function defined on the fly that is not bound to a name) for this purpose. Equivalently:

```python
for event in sorted(some_events, key=lambda e: e.start.to_int())
    ... do something
```

#### Implement comparison operator(s)

If you implement the less-than [\_\_lt\_\_](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__lt__) method for your classes (so that `time1 < time2` works), then Python now knows how to sort your custom objects.

```python
# inside class Time:
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.to_int() < other.to_int()
```



----

### Agenda: \_\_str\_\_ vs \_\_repr\_\_

You might have observed the following behavior when trying to print your Time class using the `__str__` method:

```python
>>> times = [Time(6,20), Time(2,45), Time(4)]
>>> print(times[0])
06:20:00
>>> print(times)
[<__main__.Time object at 0x105b1d0b8>, <__main__.Time object at 0x105b1d0f0>, <__main__.Time object at 0x105b1d128>]
```

This arises because Python has two ways of converting an object into a string that are used differently. Read about each:
[\_\_str\_\_](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__)
and
[\_\_repr\_\_](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__).


When printing collections like lists, the `__repr__` method is used for the contained objects. As an example of why, let's imagine we have a `TicTacToe` class with a pretty `__str__` method that gives:

```python
X| |O
-----
 |X|O
-----
O|X|
```

Very nice way to visualize the state of one Tic Tac Toe board - who needs a Graphical User Interface?

But, if we used that same representation for the `__repr__` and printed a list of two `TicTacToe` objects, it would be a mess!:

```python
[X| |O
-----
 |X|O
-----
O|X| , X| |O
-----
 |X|O
-----
O|X| ]
```

vs

```python
[<__main__.TicTacToe object at 0x105b1d160>, <__main__.TicTacToe object at 0x105b1d168>]
```

When writing `__repr__` methods, a great goal is for the result to be a valid Python expression that could recreate the object (e.g. `Time(6,20,0)` not `06:20:00`).
In Python speak, ideally `eval(repr(obj)) == obj`.

If a class does not define a `__str__` method, the `__repr__` method is used instead (if it exists).
If neither exists, Python defaults to `<ClassName object at 0x(memory address)>`.

>**In short**:
> - output of `__str__` should be "nicely printable
> - output of `__repr__` should be "information-rich and unambiguous", and if possible should be valid Python to recreate the object

## Text Mining consulting

By [this point in MP3](/assignments/mini-project-3-text-mining.html#suggested-milestones) we hope that you've thought of an interesting topic to investigate and tried out a couple of relevant text data sources (note that these don't have to be the ones that you stick with for the project).

A great next step if you haven't done it already would be to generate an extensive list of interesting questions you might explore via your data set.
Using this list, you can prioritize different analysis techniques that can help you address your questions.
It's helpful to have a longer list of topics than you'll actually pursue, since as you begin to investigate you're likely to find that some may not pan out and others may have disappointing results.

We **strongly** suggest that you consult with course staff to share your project idea, potential data sources, list of research questions, and analysis strategies.
We can help by suggesting related alternatives you may not have considered and by estimating the relative difficulty of potential approaches.

## Text caching class example

We've created an
[example program]({% link files/notes/day11/textmining.py %})
to demonstrate a) caching text data as local files, and b) the utility of custom classes.

Caching text rather than re-downloading lots of times is a smart idea for many reasons, not least of which is that it is more respectful to the host of the data. For example, check out the [Project Gutenberg terms of use](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Terms_of_Use), which lay out how you may/may not access their collection and the consequences of misuse (which include getting all of Olin banned from PG - not a strong move during MP3).

You are free to build on this program in your MP3, but as with all code you
didn't write you must make sure you understand how it works (and ask questions if you don't).
Since this code was provided by course staff, you don't need to cite its source.

**Exercise**: Try adding a `lines` method to the class that returns a list of all the individual lines in the text file, so that you can use it to write code like:

```python
example = Text(my_url)
for line in example.lines():
    do_something(line)
```
