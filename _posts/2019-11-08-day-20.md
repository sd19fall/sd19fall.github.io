Each team will have 10-12 minutes total.
It's up to you exactly how you allocate the time between presentation, Q&A, and other activities.
In addition to any verbal Q&A, each team will be collecting feedback via a Google form. Links to the feedback forms for each team will be posted on Canvas for convenience.
