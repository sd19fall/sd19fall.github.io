## Today

* Inheritance review
* Drawing Classes: UML diagrams

## Next time

* No Reading Journal assigned. If you'd like something to read, check out [Think Python Chapter 19: "The Goodies"](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2020.html). This chapter has lots of fun and useful material for you to explore on your own.
* Continue work on MP4 and Project Toolboxes


## Drawing classes: shapes

In the Reading Journal you practiced refactoring a set of classes using inheritance.
Let's draw a [class diagram](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2019.html#sec217) illustrating which shape classes inherit from which.

## Inheritance practice: counters, multisets, and Bayesian statistics
If you'd like more practice or to see inheritance in another context, we have also posted [a notebook](/notes/Inheritance Counters and PMFs) that walks you through using inheritance to go from the built-in Python collection `Counter` all the way up to Bayesian statistics.
If you're interested in learning more about this topic, you should check out [Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/) or Allen's "Computational Bayesian Statistics" course.

As a side note, in order to easily access these notebooks, you might want to clone [the website repository](https://github.com/{{ site.data.github.organization }}/{{ site.data.github.organization }}.github.io).  All the notebooks are in the `notebooks` directory of the repository.
