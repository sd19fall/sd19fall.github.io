## For next time

* Final project proposal due Tuesday (one submission per team), but don't wait to get started!
* Toolbox 4 deadline extended due to Olin Fall Gathering
* Reading Journal assigned for next class


## MP4 show

Today we'll be showing off and celebrating your work from MP4! With your partner, set up a station with a laptop to demo your MP4 work (if you place it near the boards you can write a title above.)

We'll divide the session in two - for the first half you should stay with the demo station and explain your project to visitors while your partner walks around visiting projects, then in the second half you will switch roles.


## Final project proposal

With your final project team, work on and submit your [project proposal](/assignments/final-project.html#project-proposal) to Canvas.
