## For Next Time

* Add README to your project repository, update your architecture diagram, make sure your code has good documentation, organization, and style (see Exercises below)
* Submit [Code Review framing survey]({{ page.code_review_survey }}) today (instructions below)


## READMEs

Every project should have a README file explaining what it does, how to run it, etc.
On GitHub in particular, this is your project's landing page and the first impression people will have of your work.

**Exercise:**

With your team, share your list of important README elements from the previous Reading Journal. 
Combine these with the guidelines from the final project [README rubric](/assignments/final-project/readme-rubric.html) and use them to improve your project's README.

Even though you are not yet done with your project and thus may not be able to complete every section of the project README, we'd like you to update your draft of the README today to help provide context for the code review exercise.

## Code Reviews

For some motivation from everyone's favorite site, please check out this quote from Jeff Atwood.

Code reviews are widely used in industry as a means to improve code quality.  Often, code reviews will be required before finalizing any contributions to a software repository.  For instance, a very common workflow for code reviews is to use Git branches for feature development, which are merged into the master branch only after detailed comments are provided and any issues are resolved. (If you'd like to try out using [branches in Git](/notes/day-14#going-beyond-git-branches), go for it!)

There are lots of good resources on the nuts and bolts of implementing code reviews in different settings. 
Regardless of the technical details of the review, it's important to remember that
[there is a person on the other side of the review](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/), and to approach the exercise with respect and [awareness of your own biases](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/03/08/gender-bias-code-reviews/).

Starting with today's class, course instructors will be doing a review of your team's code.  The purpose of this review is a bit different than the code reviews described above, in that we are not seeking to find every last tiny error in the code.  Rather, we will focus on providing course corrections and high-level feedback that can help you shape your work over the final weeks of the project.  As such, we'd like you to engage with the following steps to frame your code review.

**1) Prepare your repository for external readers and code review**:

Work through the exercises below to prepare your project repository for the review. You should:
 - *Post project README file*
 - *Update and post system architecture diagram* that you worked on [day 19](/notes/day-19#final-project-first-draft)
 - *Solid documentation throughout*, (see guidelines below) but especially the sections under review. 
 - *Check project organization*, make sure your files and folder names are logical, remove dead code (e.g., files or functions are no longer utilized) and non-project junk (e.g. ```.pyc``` files, generated program outputs)


**2) Point us in the right direction**:

Fill out the [code review framing form]({{ page.code_review_survey }}) to help us to give you the most useful feedback possible.  Please take a look at the survey so that you have a sense of what information we are asking for.

Some ideas for choosing code sections:
 - code that you have questions about
 - code that you want to show off
 - code that you suspect may be fragile or buggy
 - code that is particularly complicated

Ensure that each code section has sufficient documentation for a reviewer to figure out when it's called, what it does, and how it does it.

In the survey we ask you to point us to 2-3 specific sections of code. 
This might be a few lines, a function, a class, or an entire file depending on what you want to review and the questions you have. Consider making your selections reflect a range of these scales - some big picture, some detail.
No matter what sections you choose, you must frame the review by explaining why you'd like us to look at that section and posing specific questions about it.
Check out the instructions on the [Recipes page](/resources/recipes/#link-to-a-section-of-code-in-github) to see how to create links to your work on GitHub.

## Documentation

Your README is a critically important part of your project documentation, but code documentation matters too.
We previously discussed [documentation expectations and tools](/notes/day-16#documentation). Review that material with your final project code in mind.

As a general guideline, (in addition to your README) you should have:
 - Docstring/header comment at the top of each module (file) explaining what it does
 - Docstring for each class, method, and (nontrivial) function
 - Comments for sections of code that are complex enough to need explanation


**Exercise:**

Ensure that your code documentation meets the standards above.
Autogenerate documentation for your project using pydoc:

```bash
pydoc path/to/my_project.py
```

This will open a help file based on your docstrings (use q to quit). 
Check that this help file would be adequate for someone using your code - try showing it to someone not on your team. Add to your documentation based on this feedback.

pydoc can also generate HTML documentation, which you can add to your project website if you like (not required).
If you want to generate truly beautiful online documentation, check out 
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/)
(the tool used to generate the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)).


## Style and Lint

We previously discussed [good style and 'lint' tools](/notes/day-16#style-and-lint). Review that material with your final project code in mind.


**Exercise:**

Run [```pylint```](https://www.pylint.org/) or [```pycodestyle```](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) (formerly called ```pep8```) on your project code and analyze the results.
You don't need to fix everything, but it's best to know what rules you're breaking and why.


## Organization

We previously discussed strategies for [organizing large Python projects on day 16](/notes/day-16#organizing-large-projects). Review that material with your final project code in mind.


**Exercise:**

Review the current organization of your project code.
Think about and sketch out how you intend to organize your work into modules grouping related code before the final submission. This should likely correspond strongly to your system architecture diagram.

As we previously noted, this type of major refactoring can create lots of merge conflicts if you are not careful. It is best to make sure everything is checked in first, do the exercise together as a team, and have test cases before and after the restructuring to make sure nothing breaks. Now might not be the right time to do the actual reorganization, and that’s OK.
